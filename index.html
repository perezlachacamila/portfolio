      <p>
        I am a conductor and choral leader with a passion for promoting music by
        female composers. I was part of the Argentine panel at the III
        International Symposium of Female Conductors (2020) and, in 2021,
        received the National Arts Fund Creation Grant to record an album with
        my choir, Anthorium Vocal. This project won the Gold Award in the "Mixed
        Choirs" category at the AAMCANT Latin American Choral Music Competition.
        In 2022, I was awarded the Mozarteum Argentino Mecenazgo Scholarship to
        study choral symphonic repertoire and opera with Maestro Carlos Vieu.
